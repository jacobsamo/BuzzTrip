## TODO:
- [X] Setup `drizzle`
- [ ] Get `Supabase working`
- [ ] Signin page using Supabase
- [X] add `react-query` into the app
- [X] add `uuid` into the app
- [ ] Bottom Sheet to include relevant information
- [ ] Ability to edit markers & collections
- [ ] customization of colours & icons
- [ ] add [jotai](https://jotai.org) for global state?


## Future 
- [ ] Clicking on a marker in the list will take you to it on the map
- [ ] Clicking a marker on the map will:
    - [ ]  show an info box above it
    - [ ] highlight it in the list
- [ ] Collapsible Collections
- Drag and drop of markers between collections
- Reordering Collections
- Multi edit markers - this would look something like changing the colour, icon and or moving them 
- collections can have a default icon and colour
