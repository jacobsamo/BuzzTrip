In any app, squashing bugs, boosting performance, and enhancing the user experience is essential. Over the past week, weâ€™ve been hard at work making BuzzTrip smoother, faster, and easier to use. In this post, weâ€™ll walk you through some of the recent improvements and the full changelog.

## Learnings

With each release, we discover new things. Here are a few key takeaways from this one:

### `navigator.sendBeacon`
When a map has no saved location, we still want it to open in the userâ€™s last view. The tricky part? You canâ€™t trigger async functions during page unload.

Thatâ€™s when we discovered [`navigator.sendBeacon`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/sendBeacon). It allows us to send a small, reliable POST request to the server *before* the page unloads â€” perfect for persisting the last known map view without interrupting the user experience.

We built a dedicated API endpoint to handle this, and itâ€™s already paying off.

### Loading States
Creating seamless loading states that match the final UI is harder than it sounds. Weâ€™ve now added a `loading.tsx` file for maps with a clean skeleton screen, ensuring maps appear instantly with a polished loading experience.

Itâ€™s a small detail, but it makes the maps loads feel more responsive.

### Marker Improvements
We revamped the marker creation and editing experience. The marker form got a complete UI upgrade (inspired by Excalidraw), and we added quick actions directly to the marker card on the map â€” letting you instantly change the icon, color, or delete/edit a marker in just a tap.

### Click-to-Search Area
In Google Maps, you can click on place names to refine your view. While we canâ€™t replicate this exactly, weâ€™ve built a similar feature: clicking anywhere on the map will now trigger a localized area search.

Itâ€™s not 100% Google, but itâ€™s close â€” and makes finding what you're after much easier.
