We have been working hard over the course of the past month to bring paths to life. Path's are a special way of customising your maps. Think of paths as drawing shapes and lines on top of the map.

This allows a vast range of things to be done now, from planning a tracks, marking a boundary of a property, event or area

## Changelog
