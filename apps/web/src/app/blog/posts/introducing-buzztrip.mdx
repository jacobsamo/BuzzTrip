Over the past few months we've been working hard to bring you the first beta release of BuzzTrip. In this release we have worked through a lot of new features to make BuzzTrip the go to mapping solution for custom personal maps.

While BuzzTrip has been in a mostly working state for quite some time this release starts to shine the light on what BuzzTrip truly is - a powerful mapping tool.

## New Features and Improvements
There are numerous features we have smashed into this release, although not all are obvious, it has been a lot of work to make it happen.

These include:
- realtime collaboration 
- speed improvements
- full UI overhaul 
  - improved mobile support
  - new landing pages
- you can add markers anywhere on the map 
- three different map styles
- improved map creation 


### Realtime Collaboration
We did a major overhaul within the app by switching our database provider across to [Convex](https://convex.dev/). This has been a huge step forward in terms of performance and reliability. Convex is able to handle realtime updates and changes to fast track our development timeline and get realtime features in our app.

### UI Overhaul
Since the start BuzzTrip has had a simple goal to make complex mapping easy. Unfortunately this has gotten away from us, so we took a step back and re-evaluated and overhauled the whole UI from landing pages to the app. We have improved the user interface and your user experience while also improving the mobile experience in the app and added new features to make it even better.

### Improved map Creation
We have improved the map creation experience by adding the ability to localise your map by choosing a location to have your map centered around.  We have also made it easy to share your map in the creation process.

Another feature we added is labels (still a work in progress). This allows you to add labels with  a custom icon, color or both along with a title and description to better describe your map for other users.

### Adding markers anywhere on the map & choose different map styles
While creating your custom map your may want to add a marker. Now you can add a marker at any location We have always allowed adding markers to Point's of Interest (POI) but now you can add markers anywhere on the map. This is a huge feature and we are excited to see what you create with it.

We have also added the ability to change the map style. This allows you to change the style of the map to match your preferences, whether that be Terrain, Roadmap or Satellite.


## Conclusion 
We have many more features still lined up over the next few months and we are excited to see what you create with BuzzTrip. We are excited to see how you use it and what you think of it.
